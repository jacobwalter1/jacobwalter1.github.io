				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p class="description">
					I am currently a senior Computer Science student at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. I have a strong foundation in
					software development, data structures, and algorithms, and I am passionate about building innovative solutions to
					real-world problems. My favorite thing about programming is the ability to create something from nothing, being able to
					see a problem in my life and develop a solution for it. I have faced challenges in my projects, such as debugging
					complex issues and optimizing performance, but I have always emerged with a deeper understanding and improved skills.
